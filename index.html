This work is meaningful to me because it is the first stop-motion animation I have watched, which is impressive. I watched it as a freshman and was surprised about how a stop-motion animation could be.
  </p>
  <p>After that, I watched almost all of the works of this artist, Jan Svankmajer, whose films are primarily about appetite or other human desires. He thinks appetite is the source of human's other passions, such as the desire for expression.</p>
  <p>In this piece of work, he discusses how the discussion could develop. To control a dialogue, even lovers probably try to take over the predominant position. Finally, this film's scene of occupying power is visualized at the end.</p>
