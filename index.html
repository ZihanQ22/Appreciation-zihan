  <p>This Work is meaningful to be because it is the first stop-motion animation which is impressive to me. I watched it when I was a freshman and I am surprised about how a stop-motion animation could be.
  </p>
  <p>After that, I watched almost all of the works of this artist, jan svankmajer, whose films are mostly about appetite or other desire of human, and he thinks appetite is the source of human's other desires, such as the disire of expression.</p>
  <p>In this piece of work, he discusses how the discussion could develop. In order to control a dialogue, even lovers probably try to take over the predominate position. Finally, the scene of occupating the power is visualized by this film at the end.</p>
